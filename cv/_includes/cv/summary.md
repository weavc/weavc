Over 6 years experience in software development and a background in ethical hacking. Specializing in backend development but passionate to continue developing my skills in DevOps, infrastructure, and security. 

Currently working as part of an integration team, primarily focused on building robust, scalable applications using .NET (C#), Azure, MongoDb and Terraform to phase out our legacy AS400 sales based ordering system.
