TOTP or time-based one time passwords are seen throughout the internet, used in most 2 factor authentication systems. This is a small library that allows you to generate secrets, create and verify the 6 digit codes generated by applications like [Google Authenticator](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator). 

The main reason I made this was because at the time there weren't many options for javascript implementations, and I wanted to understand how 2fa worked.. So I threw this together and it seemed to work quite well.
